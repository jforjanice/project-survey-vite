# Survey Project

This weeks project was to create a survey with react. We worked in team and we created a survey where you provide information about your cat to find a catsitter. 

## Getting Started with the Project

### Dependency Installation & Startup Development Server

Once cloned, navigate to the project's root directory and this project uses npm (Node Package Manager) to manage its dependencies.

The command below is a combination of installing dependencies, opening up the project on VS Code and it will run a development server on your terminal.

```bash
npm i && code . && npm run dev
```

### The Problem

We started off with the different questions, and created components for each question, when that was done we moved on to connect each file to each other and then worked with the summary and to get the answers to be displayed after submitted. 

### View it live

Every project should be deployed somewhere. Be sure to include the link to the deployed project so that the viewer can click around and see what it's all about.
